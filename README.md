## Weather Project

## General Info

---

Weather app was created as a hometake assigment and a great practice using ReactJS and learning more about the API, callbacks, passong props, using the UseEffect and useState. Here is the deployed version

```

```

## Back-End API

---

The initial API for this project is API openWeather `https://openweathermap.org/api` there I initially used the doc for Current Weather Data, but then find the Daily Forecast 16 days `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?&cnt=7&units=imperial&${usezipparam}&appid=${API_KEY} `

Side information: To use the application in a special environment use `http://localhost:3000/` to see the landing page.

In the folder Weather you will find two different components: Weather.js and Days.js. Those are the main components for my application and where the data is passing and showing.
